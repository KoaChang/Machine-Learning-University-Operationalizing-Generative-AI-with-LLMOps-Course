A full review of LLM evaluation methods is outside of the scope of this course. However, from an LLMOps perspective, a useful framework to operationalize LLM evaluation is to pose the problem as a test-case scenario. \n",

    "NLP metrics are quantitative measures for evaluating how well a system accomplishes a particular task in NLP, such as text classification, machine translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Some common examples of metrics traditionally used in NLP include [perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity) for language models, [accuracy and F1 score](https://txt.cohere.com/classification-eval-metrics/) for classification tasks, and [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) for machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that no single metric is perfect, and different tasks require different evaluation strategies. Additionally, human evaluation and qualitative analysis are often necessary to complement quantitative metrics in assessing the performance of NLP systems. Understanding and selecting appropriate NLP metrics is very important for accurately evaluating the performance of NLP models and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics for open-ended question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Your LLM-based application is tasked with answering AWS-specific questions in an open-ended manner. For this NLP task, a suitable evaluation of the response given by the system requires comparing the system-provided answer with a reference solution, or ground truth, that is deemed factually correct, well formulated, and appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we present a series of metrics that can be used to make such comparison. When evaluating open-ended question answering systems with LLMs, it is common to use a combination of these metrics to capture different aspects of the generated responses, such as lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and overall quality. Additionally, human evaluation is often used alongside these automatic metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the system's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add FlockEval as a dependency to access LLM evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use library [FlockEval](https://code.amazon.com/packages/FlockEval/trees/mainline) to automate computation of LLM evaluation metrics. \n",

    "5. **LLM correctness textual rating**: FlockEval provides a second model-based evaluation metric named `LLMCorrectnessTextualRatingMetric` that asks the judge model to compare ground truth and system answer across the \"Correctness\" dimension. The actual prompt can be seen [here](https://code.amazon.com/packages/FlockEval/blobs/849fab3f4fc6f0c6f504fe62840cfaea48360820/--/src/flock_eval/similarity/text.py#L216). The output is between 0 and 1, where:\n",
    "- A score of 0.5 means the system solution is roughly equivalent to the ground truth overall\n",
    "- A score greater than 0.5 means the system solution is better than the ground truth overall. The\n",
    "higher the score, the better the system solution is in comparison.\n",
    "- A score less than 0.5 means the system solution is worse than the ground truth overall. The lower\n",
    "the score, the worse the system solution is in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric allows the LLM judge to score the system solution as higher quality than the ground truth. `LLMCorrectnessTextualRatingMetric` has been shown to correlate better with human judgement from topic matter experts than other alternatives. If used for integration tests to alert of perfomance degradation after model changes, the threshold should can be set as 0.5. Values lower than that mean that the new answer is worse than the old one. "

    "([Go to top](#0))\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real LLMOps deployment scenario, a typical development process might include making changes to an existing LLM-powered service. These updates might consist of improvements via prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, model replacement, addition of RAG capabilities, and other techniques. On occassion, apparent enhancements on one area might degrade the performance of the system on others. Akin to [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in software development, test cases can be introduced to control and monitor the quality of the LLM-generated output. \n",
    "\n",
    "This framework relies on the comparison of two system setups:\n",
    "- the current system `A`, that needs to be evaluated. \n",
    "- the baseline (ground truth) system `G`, that represents the perfect solution for a given task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ground truth can be assumed to represent a human-generated answer and must have been vetted, and possibly refined, by subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system runs the `A` vs `G` evaluation on a number of test cases composed of realistic problems, the system responds to them, and the ideal solutions to generate metrics that answer the question **“How good is the system output `A` compared to the ground truth `G`?”**. Many test cases can be combined in a holistic test suite. Once all test cases in a test suite are evaluated in a test run, results are aggregated to compute final scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a particular candidate configuration for deployment fails to pass the tests and its output is evaluated as worse than the baseline, the pipeline can automatically reject said configuration, avoiding the deployment of a suboptimal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For extensive testing of a model's capabilities in reference-based evaluation, you will need to build a test dataset comprised of all test cases available for a given system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each test case contains three core elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input**: Full input to the system, this represents all information the system consumes to generate the output. For QA this corresponds to the posed question.\n",
    "* **Ground Truth Solution**: Reference (ideal) outputs. For QA this corresponds to the ground truth (reference) answer to the posed question.\n",
    "* **(Optional) System Solution**: The outputs of the system. For QA this corresponds to the system answer to the posed question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system solution is optional, as it might not be known a priori and can be generated at runtime from the input.\n",
